# HackerPY64V0

HackerPY64V0 is an experimental project built on the SM64 Ursina Engine—a fusion of the iconic Super Mario 64 gameplay mechanics with the modern, Python-powered Ursina Engine. This project serves as a framework for exploring classic SM64-inspired mechanics, visuals, and level design in a flexible, easy-to-modify environment.

## Features

- **SM64 Ursina Engine Based:** Combines the nostalgic feel of SM64 with the simplicity and power of the Ursina Engine.
- **Modern Python Integration:** Leverages Python 3 and Ursina’s rapid development features.
- **Modular & Expandable:** Easily extendable to add new levels, mechanics, and visual effects.
- **Educational & Experimental:** Ideal for learning game development and prototyping new ideas.
